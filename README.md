# CSS-integration

In this exercise we need to recreate two css integration as perfect as we can with the skills we learned so far. It's a solo exercise so we can search help on the internet but not with our colleagues. Here are the rules:

- This is a solo challenge. And since this is also a mock test, you are not allowed to ask for help from your fellow juniors this time ãƒ„
You are allowed, of course, to use documentation sites, Google, stackoverflow.com and any other resource that you would normally use. Internet is your friend.
- You may use SASS and/or a CSS framework if it makes the job easier, but it will not give you extra points.
- Commit (and push) at least once every hour (set a timer to remind you if you need to).
- If there is anything that you don't understand about this exercise, ask your coach on your promotion's Discord channel!
